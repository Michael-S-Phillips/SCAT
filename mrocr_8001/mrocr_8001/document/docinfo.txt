The primary documentation for the CRISM Type Spectra data set is the paper
by Viviano-Beck et al., "Revised CRISM Spectral Parameters and Summary 
Products Based on the Currently Detected Mineral Diversity On Mars," which 
describes the general approach to the data collection and processing for 
the archive. The published version is not included in the archive due 
to copyright restrictions, however it may be accessed via the Wiley website 
with a subscription
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014JE004627/full).
