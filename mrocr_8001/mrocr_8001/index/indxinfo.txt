The INDEX directory contains an index table, INDEX.TAB, that lists every data
product in the archive. The index table is accompanied by a PDS label,
INDEX.LBL, that describes the format of the table.

The index table is an ASCII text file. Each line (record) in INDEX.TAB
contains information about a data product in the archive. The record includes
the path and file name of the PDS label that describes the data product. 

Each line in INDEX.TAB consists of a set of fixed-length fields delimited by
commas. INDEX.LBL tells the start byte, number of bytes, and data type of
each field. Character fields are enclosed in double quotation marks (").
