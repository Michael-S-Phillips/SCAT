The BROWSE directory contains PNG-format images of plots of the spectra 
in the CRISM Type Spectra data set. 

Files with names like <name>_ratioedifplot.png are plots of 
CRISM ratioed I/F corrected data, column 2 in the corresponding data file. 

Files with names like <name>_numerifpl.png are plots of
CRISM I/F numerator corrected, column 4 in the corresponding data file.

Files with names like <name>_denomifpl.png are plots of
CRISM I/F denominator corrected, column 6 in the corresponding data file.

Each image is accompanied by a PDS label file with the same name but with
the extension "lbl".
