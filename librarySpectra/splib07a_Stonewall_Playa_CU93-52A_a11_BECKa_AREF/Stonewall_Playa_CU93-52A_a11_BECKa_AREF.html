The field spectra where collected in a polygonal areadenoted by the GPS coordinates corners given above.  Spectra werecollected while holding the spectrometer fiber optic about 1 meter abovethe surface and walking while collecting.  This  method smears thespectrum collection over an oval area a couple of meters long.  About 6offset traverses were made in each of two orthogonal direction withinthe sample polygon.  This polygon is located a couple of hundred metersnortheast of the big engraved "peace" sign.  All 174 spectra wereaveraged, then corrected to absolute reflectance using a NationalInstitute of Standards spectralon correction.  Atmospheric absorptionswere minimal during spectral collection and were removed from theaveraged spectrum by physically moving the spectrum data points one at atime into positions corresponding to the ground reflectance given bylaboratory spectra of a series of field samples.  Only data points near1.2, 1.4, 1.9, and 2.05 microns were modified in this way to remove alltraces of atmospheric residues in the field spectra.  The samplepolygon is approximately a few hundred meters on a side.<p><p><p><p>END_SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION.<p><p>XRD_ANALYSIS:<p>Quartz (major), anorthite (minor), albite (minor), calcite (minor),orthoclase (minor), muscovite (minor), montmorillonite (minor),kaolinite (trace), magnesiohornblende (trace).

Spectral absorptions are weak with the strongest 1.908 microns dueto adsorbed or structural water in hydrated phases.  The 1st OH overtoneis located at 1.4110 microns.  There is a weak Fe-absorption at 0.9127microns.  The 6% band at 2.2074 microns is mostly due to montmorillonitewith contributions from muscovite.  A very weak calcite band may beindicated by a .3% absorption at 2.344 microns.<p>END_SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION.<p>SPECTRAL_PURITY: 1a2_3_4_     # 1= 0.2-3, 2= 1.5-6, 3= 6-25, 4= 20-150 microns</BODY></HTML>
