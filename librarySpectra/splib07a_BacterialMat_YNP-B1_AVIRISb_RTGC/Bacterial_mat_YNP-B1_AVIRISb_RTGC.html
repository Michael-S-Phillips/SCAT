Thirty spectra of themat were measured in the field using a field spectrometer.  These spectrawere averaged and convolved to the wavelength and bandpass characteristicsof the Airborne Visible and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS).Channels 106-117, 150-178, and 214-221 were deleted due to artifactscaused by atmospheric water vapor and low signal-to-noise at longerwavelengths.<p>The bacterial mat was composed of two thermophilic species(<i>Chloroflexus aurantiacus</i> and <i>Synechococcus lividus</i>).The color of the bacterial mat was orange.  This coloration islikely due to pigments in the cyanobacterium <i>S. lividus</i>.In addition to the overall orange coloration of the mat,streaks of green and white filaments were present.<p>END_SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION.<p>COMPOSITIONAL_ANALYSIS_TYPE: none<p>COMPOSITION_DISCUSSION:<p>END_COMPOSITION_DISCUSSION.<p>TRACE_ELEMENT_ANALYSIS: none<p>TRACE_ELEMENT_DISCUSSION:<p>END_TRACE_ELEMENT_DISCUSSION.<p>SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION:<p>END_SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION.<p>SPECTRAL_PURITY:  1b2_3_4_     # 1= 0.2-3, 2= 1.5-6, 3= 6-25, 4= 20-150 microns</BODY></HTML>
