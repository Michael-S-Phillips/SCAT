Ilmenite.  Norway (231B).  Ilmenite, FeTiO<sub>3</sub>, is sometimesfound in veins or large masses as a product of magmatic segregation, andas beds or lenses in metamorphic rocks.  Most commonly, it is anaccessory mineral in igneous rocks, and it is frequently associated withthe heavy fraction of beach and river sands.  As in the case of this <br>sample, ilmenite is typically an opaque, almost spectrally featurelessmineral in the visible and near-infrared.  The relative reflectivity ofthe various particle sizes is typical of an opaque mineral--i.e., thesmaller the particle size, the lower the reflectivity.  Pure ilmenite isconsidered to be a titanate of ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup> Ti<sup>4+</sup>O<sub>3</sub>)rather than a double sesquioxide of ferric iron and titanium (Fe<sup>3+</sup>Ti<sup>3+</sup> O<sub>3</sub>).  In ilmenite ferric oxide is often present and canintroduce features typical of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion.  When as little as 1% Tiis substituted in Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the titanium acts as a donor and is allionized to Ti<sup>4+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and the Fe<sup>2+</sup> produces a broadfeature centered near 1.5&#181;.  We have already observed a broad featurecentered near 1.8&#181; in the pyroxenes (see Part I) which was attributedto the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion in a disordered octahedral site.  The hydratedtitanium ion (Ti<sup>3+</sup> 6H<sub>2</sub>O) produces a very broad spectral featureextending from 0.5&#181; into the infrared with a maximum at 2.0&#181;.  Theoverall opacity of ilmenite is probably caused by a combination of allthese features, broadened by defects, edge effects and the presence ofimpurities, as well as conduction bands due to both the iron andtitanium extending out from the ultraviolet into the visible."<p>Hunt, G.R., J.W.
