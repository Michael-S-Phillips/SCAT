Salisbury, 1971, Visible and near-infraredspectra of minerals and rocks:  II. Carbonates.  ModernGeology, v. 2, p. 23-30.<p>With the following notes: <br>"Magnesite, MgCO<sub>3</sub>, is a carbonate mineral commonly found inveins, and derived from the alteration of serpentine.  Suchmagnesites are compact and not recognizably crystalline.Crystalline magnesite is found in sedimentary rocks, where it hasformed either by primary precipitation or by alteration of dolomite."<p>"This sample is of the compact, non-crystalline variety.  It appearsmineralogically pure in hand specimen, but its spectrum displaysbands other than those due to the carbonate ion at the longerwavelengths.  These bands near 1.4 and 1.9&#181;m are due to water ofhydration and so the sample must be, at least in part, composed ofhydromagnesite, roughly     Mg<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>&#8226;4H<sub>2</sub>O.X-ray diffraction indicates only magnesite, but heating to 800&#176;Cshows the presence of 1.78% H<sub>2</sub>O by weight, confirming thepresence of some water of hydration.  The water band near 1.9&#181;mprecludes observation of the three weaker vibrational bands of thecarbonate radical."<p>END_SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION.<p><p>XRD_ANALYSIS:<p>pure magnesite - Hunt and Salisbury as noted in above sampledescription.<p>40 kV - 30 mA, 6.5-9.5 keV <br> Reference: JCPDS #8-479 <br> Found: Member of the calcite group, probably magnesite, plus at        least one additional, poorly crystallized phase. <br> Sought but not found: brucite <br><br> Comment: sharp pattern of crystalline carbonate closely matches          the JCPDS card for magnesite.  I don't understand why          the (012) reflection is missing - but it doesn't appear          on the JCPDS card, either.  There is a moderately weak,          broad peak (doublet) at 21 degrees 2 theta - thus the comment about          the additional phase.  Could opaline silica be present??"<p>J.S. Huebner, J. Pickrell, and T. Schaefer , 1994,  written communication.<p>Magnesite is major phase with minor amount of clay (most likely expandable smectite); no hydromagnetsite was detectable with XRD.  B.
