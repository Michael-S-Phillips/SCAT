Fine grained powder  was mixed with water and an eye-dropper was used to deposit a thin coating on  a microscope glass thin section. The sample was dried over night and them measured  spectrally. Our goal was to unsaturate the goethite bands and mimic the spectral  absorptions found in natural goethite coatings.<p>END_SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION.<p>XRD_ANALYSIS:<p>Pure Hematite  (See Hematite GDS27)<p>END_XRD_ANALYSIS.<p>COMPOSITIONAL_ANALYSIS_TYPE: None      # XRF, EPMA, ICP(Trace), WChem<p>COMPOSITION_TRACE: None<p>COMPOSITION_DISCUSSION:<p>None<p>END_COMPOSITION_DISCUSSION.<p>MICROSCOPIC_EXAMINATION:<p><p>END_MICROSCOPIC_EXAMINATION.<p>For hematite powder: <br>  average grain size = 200 microns (aggregates) Material opaque, but hematite red in  powdered form. No impurities observed. Large 50-150 micron grain aggregates are  composed of 2-3  micron grains. G. Swayze.<p>SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION:<p>Spectrum has Fe-related absorptions characteristic of hematite.  Bands arelocated at 0.5427, 0.6615, and 0.8675 microns.  Of note is the narrow width ofthe 0.8675 micron band:  it is only 157 nm wide -- much narrower than inspectra of powdered hematite samples.  Apparently the band narrows most on thelong wavelength side of this band in coatings.<p>END_SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION.<p>SPECTRAL_PURITY: 1a2_3_4_     # 1= 0.2-3, 2= 1.5-6, 3= 6-25, 4= 20-150 microns</BODY></HTML>
