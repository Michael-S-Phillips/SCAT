Siderite.  Roxbury, Conn. (68, hand-ground).  Siderite, FeCO<sub>3</sub>,is found in extensive sedimentary beds, frequently contaminated with clay ororganic matter.  It is also commonly deposited in veins by hydrothermalsolutions.  Both magnesium and manganese commonly substitute for the iron.This particular sample is coarsely crystalline and medium brown in color.  Itis high in iron, as indicated by the strong ferrous ion band near 1.1&#181;.  Itis also slightly contaminated with magnetite.  Being an opaque material, themagnetite lowers the overall reflectivity of the sample, makes the carbonatebands less prominent, and causes the crossover of the spectral curves in thevisible.  Analysis shows that this sample contains 0.98% Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 7.03%Mn<sup>+2</sup>.  However, the electronic transitions of iron dominate the spectrumto such an extent that none of the sharp features due to Mn<sup>++</sup> are apparentin the visible spectrum."NOTE: This a different sample number than this sample (271) but thecollection locality is the same.  Possibly a mislabeled sample.<p>Hunt, G.R., J.W.  Salisbury, 1971, Visible and near-infrared spectra ofminerals and rocks:  II.  Carbonates.
