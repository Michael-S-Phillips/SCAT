Halite. Kansas (433B). Halite, NaCl, occurs primarily as extensive beds  formed by evaporation of trapped bodies of salt water. It may also form as an  efflorescence on the surface in arid areas, or as a sublimation product in volcanic  regions. It is colorless when pure, but more typically orange or red, and may  be gray, yellow or blue. The common orange or red color is due to inclusions  of ferric oxide material, while the gray is due to inclusions of clay. Like  many of the halides, halite is subject to color center formation, which is responsible  for the blue and purple tints. This sample is colorless and appears to be quite  pure. It displays some very weak water bands from water in fluid inclusions  near 1.95 and 2.25 &#181;, but is otherwise spectrally featureless, except for  the 0-5 &#181; particle size range. The distinct brownish tone of this size  range is caused by polyurethane contamination from the fluid energy mill."<p>Hunt, G.R., J.W.  Salisbury, and C.J.
